# Digit Recognizer
Ever wondered what digits look like through the eyes of a neural network that was raised on pure NumPy?  
This repo is a humble attempt to build a digit recognizer from scratch — no TensorFlow, no PyTorch, just NumPy, mathematics, and a bit of patience.

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook walks through building a feedforward neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It includes:
- Manual data preprocessing
- Neural network architecture from scratch
- Forward and backward propagation
- Gradient descent training loop
- Accuracy evaluation

## 📊 Sample Results
Training Accuracy: ~92% (depending on hyperparameters and training time)
Test Set: Digit classification via 784-dimensional pixel input

## 🎯 Motivation
This project was created as a hands-on exercise to demystify how neural networks work under the hood — before diving into high-level frameworks.
